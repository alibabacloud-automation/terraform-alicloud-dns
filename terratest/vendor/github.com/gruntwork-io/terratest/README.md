Terratest is a Go library that makes it easier to write automated tests for your infrastructure code. It provides a
variety of helper functions and patterns for common infrastructure testing tasks, including:

- Testing Terraform code
- Testing Packer templates
- Testing Docker images
- Executing commands on servers over SSH
- Working with AWS APIs
- Working with GCP APIs
- Working with Kubernetes APIs
- Testing Helm Charts
- Making HTTP requests
- Running shell commands
- And much more

Terratest was developed at [Gruntwork](https://gruntwork.io/) to help maintain the [Infrastructure as Code
Library](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/), which contains over 250,000 lines of code written
in Terraform, Go, Python, and Bash, and is used in production by hundreds of companies. See [Open sourcing Terratest: a
swiss army knife for testing infrastructure code](https://blog.gruntwork.io/open-sourcing-terratest-a-swiss-army-knife-for-testing-infrastructure-code-5d883336fcd5)
for more info.




## Introduction

The basic usage pattern for writing automated tests with Terratest is to:

1.  Write tests using Go's built-in [package testing](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/): you create a file ending in
    `_test.go` and run tests with the `go test` command.
1.  Use Terratest to execute your _real_ IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Packer, etc.) to deploy _real_ infrastructure
    (e.g., servers) in a _real_ environment (e.g., AWS).
1.  Validate that the infrastructure works correctly in that environment by making HTTP requests, API calls, SSH
    connections, etc.
1.  Undeploy everything at the end of the test.

Here's a simple example of how to test some Terraform code:

```go
terraformOptions := &terraform.Options {
  // The path to where your Terraform code is located
  TerraformDir: "../examples/terraform-basic-example",
}

// At the end of the test, run `terraform destroy` to clean up any resources that were created
defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)

// This will run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` and fail the test if there are any errors
terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

// Validate your code works as expected
validateServerIsWorking(t, terraformOptions)
```




## Quickstart

### Install requirements

Terratest uses the Go testing framework. To use terratest, you need to install:

- [Go](https://golang.org/) (requires version >=1.10)
- [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) (requires version >=0.5.1)


### Setting up your project

1. Golang requires go source files to be available in the `GOPATH`. By default this is typically `$HOME/go/src`. Create
   a new blank folder in the `GOPATH` to hold your terraform module and terratest code. For example, if you were
   developing a VPC module named `terraform-aws-vpc`, create the folder `$HOME/go/src/terraform-aws-vpc` to hold your
   module code.
1. In the project folder, create three subfolders:
    1. `modules`: This folder should contain your terraform modules that will be tested.
    1. `examples`: This folder should contain examples of how to use the modules. These should be self-contained
       deployable examples. Meaning, it should provision all the resources that are necessary to run the modules in the
       `modules` folder.
    1. `test`: This folder should contain your terratest code.
1. Copy the [basic terraform
   example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/tree/master/examples/terraform-basic-example) into the `examples`
   folder.
1. Copy the [basic terraform example
   test](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/blob/master/test/terraform_basic_example_test.go) into the `test`
   folder.
1. In the `test` folder, create a `Gopkg.toml` file with the following content:

```
[[constraint]]
  name = "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest"
  version = "0.17.4"
```

Now you should be able to run the example test. To run the test:

1. Change your working directory to the `test` folder.
1. Run `dep ensure`
    - This will download all the dependencies to the current directory (in this case, the `test` folder) under the
      folder `vendor`. You should only need to run this when you update the `Gopkg.toml` file, or if you have not run it
      previously on the machine (e.g in a CI environment).
    - This will create a new file `Gopkg.lock`. This file acts as an index of all the versions of every dependency you
      need.
    - You should check in the `Gopkg.lock` file that is generated so that all future calls to `dep ensure` will be
      consistent, but you should NOT check in the `vendor` folder, as that can be recreated using `dep ensure` from the
      `Gopkg.lock` file.
1. Each time you want to run the tests, use `go test -v -timeout 90m .`
    - Note that `go` has a default test timeout of 10 minutes. With infrastructure testing, your tests will surpass the
      10 minutes very easily. To extend the timeout, you can pass in the `-timeout` option, which takes a `go` duration
      string (e.g `10m` for 10 minutes or `1h` for 1 hour). In the above command, we use the `-timeout` option to
      override to a 90 minute timeout.
    - When you hit the timeout, Go automatically exits the test, **skipping all cleanup routines**. This is problematic
      for infrastructure testing because it will skip your deferred infrastructure cleanup steps (i.e `terraform
      destroy`), leaving behind the infrastructure that was spun up. So it is important to use a longer timeout
      everytime you run the tests.
    - See the [Cleanup section](#cleanup) for more information on how to setup robust clean up procedures in the face of
      test timeouts and instabilities.


### Installing the utility binaries

Terratest also ships utility binaries that you can use to improve the debugging experience (see [Debugging interleaved
test output](#debugging-interleaved-test-output). The compiled binaries are shipped separately from the library in the [Releases page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/releases).

To install a binary, download the version that matches your platform and place it somewhere on your `PATH`. For example
to install version 0.13.13 of `terratest_log_parser`:

```bash
# This example assumes a linux 64bit machine
# Use curl to download the binary
curl --location --silent --fail --show-error -o terratest_log_parser https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/releases/download/v0.13.13/terratest_log_parser_linux_amd64
# Make the downloaded binary executable
chmod +x terratest_log_parser
# Finally, we place the downloaded binary to a place in the PATH
sudo mv terratest_log_parser /usr/local/bin
```

Alternatively, you can use [the gruntwork-installer](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer), which will do
the above steps and automatically select the right binary for your platform:

```bash
gruntwork-install --binary-name 'terratest_log_parser' --repo 'https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest' --tag 'v0.13.13'
```

The following binaries are currently available with `terratest`:

| Command                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **terratest_log_parser** | Parses test output from the `go test` command and breaks out the interleaved logs into logs for each test. Integrate with your CI environment to help debug failing tests. |


## Examples

The best way to learn how to use Terratest is through examples.

First, check out the [examples folder](/examples) for different types of infrastructure code you may want to test,
such as:

1.  [Basic Terraform Example](/examples/terraform-basic-example): A simple "Hello, World" Terraform configuration.
1.  [HTTP Terraform Example](/examples/terraform-http-example): A more complicated Terraform configuration that deploys
    a simple web server that responds to HTTP requests in AWS.
1.  [Basic Packer Example](/examples/packer-basic-example): A simple Packer template for building an Amazon Machine
    Image (AMI) or Google Cloud Platform Compute Image.
1.  [Terraform Packer Example](/examples/terraform-packer-example): A more complicated example that shows how to use
    Packer to build an AMI with a web server installed and deploy that AMI in AWS using Terraform.
1.  [Terraform GCP Example](/examples/terraform-gcp-example): A simple Terraform configuration that creates a GCP Compute Instance and Storage Bucket.
1.  [Terraform remote-exec Example](/examples/terraform-remote-exec-example): A terraform configuration that creates and
    AWS instance and then uses `remote-exec` to provision it.
1.  [Basic Kubernetes Example](/examples/kubernetes-basic-example): A minimal Kubernetes resource that deploys an
    addressable nginx instance.
1.  [Kubernetes RBAC Example](/examples/kubernetes-rbac-example): A Kubernetes resource config that creates a Namespace
    with a ServiceAccount that has admin permissions within the Namespace, but not outside.
1.  [Basic Helm Chart Example](/examples/helm-basic-example): A minimal helm chart that deploys a `Deployment` resource
    for the provided container image.

Next, head over to the [test folder](/test) to see how you can use Terratest to test each of these examples:

1.  [terraform_basic_example_test.go](/test/terraform_basic_example_test.go): Use Terratest to run `terraform apply` on
    the Basic Terraform Example and verify you get the expected outputs.
1.  [terraform_http_example_test.go](/test/terraform_http_example_test.go): Use Terratest to run `terraform apply` on
    the HTTP Terraform Example to deploy the web server, make HTTP requests to the web server to check that it is
    working correctly, and run `terraform destroy` to undeploy the web server.
1.  [packer_basic_example_test.go](/test/packer_basic_example_test.go): Use Terratest to run `packer build` to build an
    AMI and then use the AWS APIs to delete that AMI.
1.  [packer_gcp_basic_example_test.go](/test/packer_gcp_basic_example_test.go): Use Terratest to run `packer build`
    to build a Google Cloud Platform Compute Image and then use the GCP APIs to delete that image.
1.  [terraform_packer_example_test.go](/test/terraform_packer_example_test.go): Use Terratest to run `packer build` to
    build an AMI with a web server installed, deploy that AMI in AWS by running `terraform apply`, make HTTP requests to
    the web server to check that it is working correctly, and run `terraform destroy` to undeploy the web server.
1.  [terraform_gcp_example_test.go](/test/terraform_gcp_example_test.go): Use Terratest to run `terraform apply` on
    the Terraform GCP Example and verify you get the expected outputs.
1.  [terraform_remote_exec_example_test.go](/test/terraform_remote_exec_example_test.go): Use Terratest to run 
    `terraform apply` and then remotely provision the instance while using a custom SSH agent managed by Terratest
1.  [terraform_scp_example_test.go](/test/terraform_scp_example_test.go): Use Terratest to simplify copying resources
    like config files and logs from deployed EC2 Instances. This is especially useful for getting a snapshot of the
    state of a deployment when a test fails.
1.  [kubernetes_basic_example_test.go](/test/kubernetes_basic_example_test.go): Use Terratest to run `kubectl apply`
    to apply a Kubernetes resource file, verify resources are created using the Kubernetes API, and then run `kubectl
    delete` to delete the resources at the end of the test.
1.  [kubernetes_rbac_example_test.go](/test/kubernetes_rbac_example_test.go): Use Terratest to run `kubectl apply` to
    apply a Kubernetes resource file, retrieve auth tokens to authenticate as the created ServiceAccount, update the
    kubeconfig file with the authentication token and add a new context to auth as the ServiceAccount, verify auth as
    the ServiceAccount by checking what resources you have access to, and finally run `kubectl delete` to delete the
    resources at the end of the test.
1.  [helm_basic_example_template_test.go](/test/helm_basic_example_template_test.go): Use Terratest to run `helm
    template` to test template rendering logic.

## Testing best practices

Testing infrastructure as code (IaC) is hard. With general purpose programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, Ruby),
you have a "localhost" environment where you can run and test the code before you commit. You can also isolate parts
of your code from external dependencies to create fast, reliable unit tests. With IaC, neither of these advantages is
typically available, as there isn't a "localhost" equivalent for most IaC code (e.g., I can't use Terraform to deploy
an AWS VPC on my own laptop) and there's no way to isolate your code from the outside world (i.e., the whole point of
a tool like Terraform is to make calls to AWS, so if you remove AWS, there's nothing left).

That means that most of the tests are going to be integration tests that deploy into a real AWS account. This makes
the tests effective at catching real-world bugs, but it also makes them much slower and more brittle. In this section,
we'll outline some best practices to minimize the downsides of this sort of testing.

### Testing environment

Since most automated tests written with Terratest can make potentially destructive changes in your environment, we
strongly recommend running tests in an environment that is totally separate from production. For example, if you are
testing infrastructure code for AWS, you should run your tests in a completely separate AWS account.

This means that you will have to write your infrastructure code in such a way that you can plug in ([dependency
injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) environment-specific details, such as account IDs,
domain names, IP addresses, etc. Adding support for this will typically make your code cleaner and more flexible.


### Namespacing

Just about all resources your tests create (e.g., servers, load balancers, machine images) should be "namespaced" with
a unique name to ensure that:

1.  You don't accidentally overwrite any "production" resources in that environment (though as mentioned in the previous
    section, your test environment should be completely isolated from prod anyway).
1.  You don't accidentally clash with other tests running in parallel.

For example, when deploying AWS infrastructure with Terraform, that typically means exposing variables that allow you
to configure auto scaling group names, security group names, IAM role names, and any other names that must be unique.

You can use Terratest's `random.UniqueId()` function to generate identifiers that are short enough to use in resource
names (just 6 characters) but random enough to make it unlikely that you'll have a conflict.

```go
uniqueId := random.UniqueId()
instanceName := fmt.Sprintf("terratest-http-example-%s", uniqueId)

terraformOptions := &terraform.Options {
  TerraformDir: "../examples/terraform-http-example",
  Vars: map[string]interface{} {
    "instance_name": instanceName,
  },
}

terraform.Apply(t, terraformOptions)
```


### Cleanup

Since automated tests with Terratest deploy real resources into real environments, you'll want to make sure your tests
always cleanup after themselves so you don't leave a bunch of resources lying around. Typically, you should use Go's
`defer` keyword to ensure that the cleanup code always runs, even if the test hits an error along the way.

For example, if your test runs `terraform apply`, you should run `terraform destroy` at the end to clean up:

```go
// Ensure cleanup always runs
defer terraform.Destroy(t, options)

// Deploy
terraform.Apply(t, options)

// Validate
checkServerWorks(t, options)
```

Of course, despite your best efforts, occasionally cleanup will fail, perhaps due to the CI server going down, or a bug
in your code, or a temporary network outage. To handle those cases, we run a tool called
[cloud-nuke](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke) in our test AWS account on a nightly basis to clean up any
leftover resources.


### Timeouts and logging

Go's package testing has a default timeout of 10 minutes, after which it forcibly kills your tests (even your cleanup
code won't run!). It's not uncommon for infrastructure tests to take longer than 10 minutes, so you'll want to increase
this timeout:

```bash
go test -timeout 30m
```

Note that many CI systems will also kill your tests if they don't see any log output for a certain period of time
(e.g., 10 minutes in CircleCI). If you use Go's `t.Log` and `t.Logf` for logging in your tests, you'll find that these
functions buffer all log output until the very end of the test (see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24929 for more
info). If you have a long-running test, this might mean you get no log output for more than 10 minutes, and the CI
system will shut down your tests. Moreover, if your test has a bug that causes it to hang, you won't see any log output
at all to help you debug it.

Therefore, we recommend instead using Terratest's `logger.Log` and `logger.Logf` functions, which log to `stdout`
immediately:

```go
func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
  logger.Log(t, "This will show up in stdout immediately")
}
```

Finally, if you're testing multiple Go packages, be aware that Go will buffer log output—even that sent directly to
`stdout` by `logger.Log` and `logger.Logf`—until all the tests in the package are done. This leads to the same
difficulties with CI servers and debugging. The workaround is to tell Go to test each package sequentially using the
`-p 1` flag:

```bash
go test -timeout 30m -p 1 ./...
```


### Debugging interleaved test output

**Note**: The `terratest_log_parser` requires an explicit installation. See [Installing the utility
binaries](#installing-the-utility-binaries) for installation instructions.

If you log using Terratest's `logger` package, you may notice that all the test outputs are interleaved from the
parallel execution. This may make it difficult to debug failures, as it can be tedious to sift through the logs to find
the relevant entries for a failing test, let alone find the test that failed.

Therefore, Terratest ships with a utility binary `terratest_log_parser` that can be used to break out the logs.

To use the utility, you simply give it the log output from a `go test` run and a desired output directory:

```bash
go test -timeout 30m | tee test_output.log
terratest_log_parser -testlog test_output.log -outputdir test_output
```

This will:

- Create a file `TEST_NAME.log` for each test it finds from the test output containing the logs corresponding to that
  test.
- Create a `summary.log` file containing the test result lines for each test.
- Create a `report.xml` file containing a Junit XML file of the test summary (so it can be integrated in your CI).

The output can be integrated in your CI engine to further enhance the debugging experience. See Terratest's own
[circleci configuration](/.circleci/config.yml) for an example of how to integrate the utility with CircleCI. This
provides for each build:

- A test summary view showing you which tests failed:

![CircleCI test summary](/_docs/images/circleci-test-summary.png)

- A snapshot of all the logs broken out by test:

![CircleCI logs](/_docs/images/circleci-logs.png)


### Avoid test caching

Since Go 1.10, test results are automatically [cached](https://golang.org/doc/go1.10#test). This can lead to Go not
running your tests again if you haven't changed any of the Go code. Since you're probably mainly manipulating Terraform
files, you should consider turning the caching of test results off. This ensures that the tests are run every time
you run `go test` and the result is not just read from the cache.

To turn caching off, you can use the `GOCACHE` environment variable and set it to `off`:

```shell
$ GOCACHE=off go test -timeout 30m -p 1 ./...
```


### Error handling

Just about every method `foo` in Terratest comes in two versions: `foo` and `fooE` (e.g., `terraform.Apply` and
`terraform.ApplyE`).

- `foo`: The base method takes a `t *testing.T` as an argument. If the method hits any errors, it calls `t.Fatal` to
  fail the test.

- `fooE`: Methods that end with the capital letter `E` always return an `error` as the last argument and never call
  `t.Fatal` themselves. This allows you to decide how to handle errors.

You will use the base method name most of the time, as it allows you to keep your code more concise by avoiding
`if err != nil` checks all over the place:

```go
terraform.Init(t, terraformOptions)
terraform.Apply(t, terraformOptions)
url := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "url")
```

In the code above, if `Init`, `Apply`, or `Output` hits an error, the method will call `t.Fatal` and fail the test
immediately, which is typically the behavior you want. However, if you are _expecting_ an error and don't want it to
cause a test failure, use the method name that ends with a capital `E`:

```go
if _, err := terraform.InitE(t, terraformOptions); err != nil {
  // Do something with err
}

if _, err := terraform.ApplyE(t, terraformOptions); err != nil {
  // Do something with err
}

url, err := terraform.OutputE(t, terraformOptions, "url")
if err != nil {
  // Do something with err
}
```

As you can see, the code above is more verbose, but gives you more flexibility with how to handle errors.


### Iterating locally using Docker

For most infrastructure code, your only option is to deploy into a real environment such as AWS. However, if you're
writing scripts (i.e., Bash, Python, or Go), you should be able to test them locally using Docker. Docker containers
typically build 10x faster and start 100x faster than real servers, so using Docker for testing can help you iterate
much faster.

Here are some techniques we use with Docker:

- If your script is used in a Packer template, add a [Docker
  builder](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/docker.html) to the template so you can create a Docker image from the
  same code. See the [Packer Docker Example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/tree/master/examples/packer-docker-example) for working sample code.

- We have prebuilt Docker images for major Linux distros that have many important dependencies (e.g., curl, vim,
  tar, sudo) already installed. See the [test-docker-images folder](/test-docker-images) for more details.

- Create a `docker-compose.yml` to make it easier to run your Docker image with all the ports, environment variables,
  and other settings it needs. See the [Packer Docker Example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/tree/master/examples/packer-docker-example) for working sample code.

- With scripts in Docker, you can replace _some_ real-world dependencies with mocks! One way to do this is to create
  some "mock scripts" and to bind-mount them in `docker-compose.yml` in a way that replaces the real dependency. For
  example, if your script calls the `aws` CLI, you could create a mock script called `aws` that shows up earlier in the
  `PATH`. Using mocks allows you to test 100% locally, without external dependencies such as AWS.


### Iterating locally using test stages

Most automated tests written with Terratest consist of multiple "stages", such as:

1.  Build an AMI using Packer
1.  Deploy the AMI using Terraform
1.  Validate that the AMI works as expected
1.  Undeploy the AMI using Terraform

Often, while testing locally, you'll want to re-run some subset of these stages over and over again: for example, you
might want to repeatedly run the validation step while you work out the kinks. Having to run _all_ of these stages
each time you change a single line of code can be very slow.

This is where Terratest's `test_structure` package comes in handy: it allows you to explicitly break up your tests into
stages and to be able to disable any one of those stages simply by setting an environment variable. Check out the
[terraform_packer_example_test.go](/test/terraform_packer_example_test.go) for working sample code.

1.  [ruby_terraform](https://github.com/infrablocks/ruby_terraform)


### How Terratest compares to other testing tools

Most of the other infrastructure testing tools we've seen are focused on making it easy to check the properties of a
single server or resource. For example, the various `xxx-spec` tools offer a nice, concise language for connecting to
a server and checking if, say, `httpd` is installed and running. These tools are effectively verifying that individual
"properties" of your infrastructure meet a certain spec.

Terratest approaches the testing problem from a different angle. The question we're trying to answer is, "does the
infrastructure actually work?" Instead of checking individual server properties (e.g., is `httpd` installed and
running), we'll actually make HTTP requests to the server and check that we get the expected response; or we'll store
data in a database and make sure we can read it back out; or we'll try to deploy a new version of a Docker container
and make sure the orchestration tool can roll out the new container with no downtime.

Moreover, we use Terratest not only with individual servers, but to test entire systems. For example, the automated
tests for the [Vault module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/tree/master/modules) do the following:

1.  Use Packer to build an AMI.
1.  Use Terraform to create self-signed TLS certificates.
1.  Use Terraform to deploy all the infrastructure: a Vault cluster (which runs the AMI from the previous step), Consul
    cluster, load balancers, security groups, S3 buckets, and so on.
1.  SSH to a Vault node to initialize the cluster.
1.  SSH to all the Vault nodes to unseal them.
1.  Use the Vault SDK to store data in Vault.
1.  Use the Vault SDK to make sure you can read the same data back out of Vault.
1.  Use Terraform to undeploy and clean up all the infrastructure.

The steps above are exactly what you would've done to test the Vault module manually. Terratest helps automate this
process. You can think of Terratest as a way to do end-to-end, acceptance or integration testing, whereas most other
tools are focused on unit or functional testing.


### Why Terratest?

Our experience with building the [Infrastructure as Code Library](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/)
is that the _only_ way to create reliable, maintainable infrastructure code is to have a thorough suite of real-world,
end-to-end acceptance tests. Without these sorts of tests, you simply cannot be confident that the infrastructure code
actually works.

This is especially important with modern DevOps, as all the tools are changing so quickly. Terratest has helped us
catch bugs not only in our own code, but also in AWS, Azure, Terraform, Packer, Kafka, Elasticsearch, CircleCI, and
so on. Moreover, by running tests nightly, we're able to catch backwards incompatible changes and
regressions in our dependencies (e.g., backwards incompatibilities in new versions of Terraform) as early as possible.

### Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! Check out the
[Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.


### Running tests

Terratest itself includes a number of automated tests.

**Note #1**: Some of these tests create real resources in an AWS account. That means they cost money to run, especially
if you don't clean up after yourself. Please be considerate of the resources you create and take extra care to clean
everything up when you're done!

**Note #2**: In order to run tests that access your AWS account, you will need to configure your [AWS CLI
credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html). For example, you could
set the credentials as the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

**Note #3**: Never hit `CTRL + C` or cancel a build once tests are running or the cleanup tasks won't run!

**Prerequisite**: Most the tests expect Terraform, Packer, and/or Docker to already be installed and in your `PATH`.

To run all the tests:

```bash
go test -v -timeout 30m -p 1 ./...
```

To run the tests in a specific folder:

```bash
cd "<FOLDER_PATH>"
go test -timeout 30m
```

To run a specific test in a specific folder:

```bash
cd "<FOLDER_PATH>"
go test -timeout 30m -run "<TEST_NAME>"
```


### Versioning

This repo follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release,
along with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
